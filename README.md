deps/ is for the other libraries

libs/ is the instal folder of libs, make install will be redirected here

dist/ is for the final wasm & html files (it is intentionally not in .gitignore)

build/ is for temporary build files (there is also _build that contains build artifact of dune)

backend/ is all the necessary code
